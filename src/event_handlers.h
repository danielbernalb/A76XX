    @brief Base class for URC event handlers.

    @details SIMCOM modules produce certain unsolicited result codes (URC)
        that signal certain events have occurred, e.g., when the device 
        disconnects from the network or an MQTT message is received. 
        These codes are emitted on the serial port that connects the 
        module to the micro-controller and thus need to be captured
        as they occur, to avoid them being lost in the output of 
        other AT commands that might be issued to the module by the user.

        An EventHandler_t object is composed of a match string, a corresponding
        element of the enum A76XXURC_t, i.e. an URC code, and a processing function.

        When communicating with the module, the output of the serial connection
        is monitored. When the match string of any of the active event handler is 
        found in the data stream the processing function is executed. This can be 
        useful to further information about some URCs that also contain additional
        characters, e.g. the payload of a MQTT message. Then the URC code of the 
        event is pushed to a queue for later processing. This queue can be accessed
        by calling A76XX::listen and events can be processed by the user's application.
